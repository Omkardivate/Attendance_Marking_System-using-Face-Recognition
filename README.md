# Attendance_Marking_System-using-Face-Recognition
Problem Definition:
Traditionally attendance is marked manually by teachers and they
must make sure correct attendance is marked for respective
student. This whole process wastes some of the lecture time and
part of correct information is missed due to fraudulent and proxy
cases.

In order to determine the classroom attendance, face detection and
face recognition are performed. Face detection is used to determine
the location of the faces in the classroom and to extract the sub
images of face. Then in face recognition, the face images detected by
comparing with the data base consisting of images of the students in
the class, and attendance will be recorded accordingly.
